# Kids 2.0 Tasks Writeups

<img src="./screenshots/kids_20_logo.png" alt="Logo"/>

---

Welcome to my personal collection of writeups for `Tasks` on [Kids 2.0](https://web-kids20.forkbomb.ru/).
Each writeup includes my thought process, tools used, exploitation steps, and post-exploitation notes.

Periodically I will return to the laboratories and machines I have completed and make any changes or improvements to my solutions.

## Structure

Each writeup is organized in its own directory
